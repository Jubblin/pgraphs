## Background

**Property Graphs** (also known as **Labeled Property Graphs**) are used as
abstract data structure in Graph databases and related applications. This
package implements the **Property Graph Exchange Format (PG)**.

A property graph consists of **nodes** and **edges** between these nodes. Each
edge can be directed or undirected.  Each of the nodes and edges can have a set
of zero or more **labels** and a set of and zero or more properties.
**Properties** are key-value pairs where the same key may have multiple values.
**Values** are Unicode strings or scalar values of other data types (number,
boolean, null).

*This implementation is work in progress. It may slightly differ from the format described in <https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03936>!*

### PG format

A PG file serializes a property graph as Unicode string. The format is based on
lines, separated by newlines (`U+000A` or `U+000D` followed by `U+000A`).

### PG-JSON

**PG-JSON** is a serialization of the property graph data model in JSON. A graph is encoded as JSON object with exactely two fields:

- `nodes` an array of nodes
- `edges` an array of edges

Each node is a JSON object with exactely three fields:

- `id` the internal node identifier, being a non-empty string. Node identifiers must be unique per graph.
- `labels` a (possibly empty) array of labels, each being a non-empty string. Labels must be unique per node.
- `properties` a (possibly empty) JSON object mapping non empty strings to non-empty arrays of scalar JSON values (string, number, boolean, or null)

Each edge is a JSON object with one optional and four mandatory fields:

- `undirected` (optional) a boolean value whether the edge is undirected
- `from` an identifier of a node in this graph
- `to` an identifier of a node in this graph
- `labels` a (possibly empty) array of labels, each being a non-empty string. Labels must be unique per edge.
- `properties` a (possibly empty) JSON object with properties with same definition as above in node objects.

The PG-JSON format is also defined by JSON Schema file
[`schema.json`](schema.json) in this repository. Rules not covered
by the schema:

- node ids must be unique per graph
- nodes referenced in edges must be defined
- edges must be unique per graph

### Example

The same graph in PG format and PG-JSON format:

~~~
# NODES
101 :person  name:Alice  country:"United States"
102 :person  :student  name:Bob  country:Japan

# EDGES
101 -- 102  :same_school  :same_class  since:2012
101 -> 102  :likes  since:2015
~~~

~~~json
{
  "nodes": [{
    "id": "101", "labels": [ "person" ],
    "properties": { "name": [ "Alice" ], "country": [ "United States" ] }
   },{
    "id": "102", "labels": [ "person", "student" ],
    "properties": { "name": [ "Bob" ], "country": [ "Japan" ] }
  }],
  "edges": [{
    "from": "101", "to": "102", "undirected": true,
    "labels": [ "same_school", "same_class" ], "properties": { "since": [ 2012 ] }
   },{
    "from": "101", "to": "102",
    "labels": [ "likes" ], "properties": { "since": [ 2015 ] }
  }]
}
~~~

## Install

This package has not been published at npm so you need to clone it from its git repository.

## Usage

### API

~~~
import { parse, serialize } from "pgraph"

const graph = {
  nodes: [ ... ],
  edges: [ ... ] 
}

const pgstring = serialize(graph)

const graph = parse(pgstring)
~~~

### CLI

`./bin/pg2json.js` and `./bin/json2pg.js` parse and serialize, respectively.

`./bin/neo2pg.js` can be used to dump the default graph from a Neo4J database. First argument must be a JSON file with credentials like this:

~~~json
{
  "uri": "neo4j://example.org",
  "user": "alice",
  "password": "secret"
}
~~~

Common graph databases with support of labeled property graphs include:

- [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com/) (limitations: edges have one mandatory label, multiple properties of same name must have same data type)
- [Memgraph](https://memgraph.com/) is compatible with Neo4J
- [Oracle Property Graph](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/property-graph/index.html) (implements [PGQL](https://pgql-lang.org/): empty string labels seem to be allowed)
- [Azure Cosmos DB for Gremlin](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/gremlin/) (limitations: edges have one mandatory label, no null type...) and other databases supporting [Apache TinkerPop](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/)
- [ArangoDB](https://arangodb.com/)
- ...

Alternative property graph serialization formats include

- [YARS-PG](https://github.com/lszeremeta/yarspg) and
- [GDL](https://github.com/s1ck/gdl)

Both are more complex than PG.

Many more graph formats exist (
[GraphSON](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/3.7.1/dev/io/#graphson),
[JGF](http://jsongraphformat.info/),
[GraphML](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/),
[dot](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html),
[GML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language)...)
some of which might also be able to serialize property graphs.
