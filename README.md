## Background

**Property Graphs** (also known as **Labeled Property Graphs**) are used as
abstract data structure in graph databases and related applications. This
package implements the **Property Graph Exchange Format (PG)** with parsers
and serializers from and to various formats.

A property graph consists of **nodes** and **edges** between these nodes. Each
edge can be directed or undirected.  Each of the nodes and edges can have a set
of zero or more **labels** and a set of and zero or more properties.
**properties** are key-value pairs where the same key may have multiple values.
**values** are Unicode strings or scalar values of other data types.

Implementations of property graphs slightly differ in support of data types,
restrictions on labels etc. The property graph model PG is aimed to be a
superset of property graph models of common graph databases. The model and its
serializations **PG format** and **PG-JSON** have first been
proposed by Hirokazu Chiba, Ryota Yamanaka, and Shota Matsumoto
([2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03936), [2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06393)).

A [formal description of Property Graph Exchange Format ](./docs/pg-format.md)
and [an illustrating example](./docs/pg-format.pg) can be found [in the `docs`
directory](./docs) of this repository. There is also a JSON Schema
[`pg-schema.json`](pg-schema.json) to define and validate PG-JSON.

To give an example, the same graph in PG format and PG-JSON format:

~~~
# NODES
101 :person  name:Alice  country:"United States"
102 :person  :student  name:Bob  country:Japan

# EDGES
101 -- 102  :same_school  :same_class  since:2012
101 -> 102  :likes  since:2015
~~~

~~~json
{
  "nodes": [{
    "id": "101", "labels": [ "person" ],
    "properties": { "name": [ "Alice" ], "country": [ "United States" ] }
   },{
    "id": "102", "labels": [ "person", "student" ],
    "properties": { "name": [ "Bob" ], "country": [ "Japan" ] }
  }],
  "edges": [{
    "from": "101", "to": "102", "undirected": true,
    "labels": [ "same_school", "same_class" ], "properties": { "since": [ 2012 ] }
   },{
    "from": "101", "to": "102",
    "labels": [ "likes" ], "properties": { "since": [ 2015 ] }
  }]
}
~~~

## Install

This package has not been published at npm so you need to clone it from its git repository.

~~~
git clone https://github.com/gbv/pg.git
cd pg
npm install
~~~

## Usage

### API

~~~
import { parse, serialize, ParsingError } from "pgraph"

const graph = {
  nodes: [ ... ],
  edges: [ ... ] 
}

try {
  const pgstring = serialize(graph)
  const graph = parse(pgstring)
} catch (ParsingError e) {
  console.log(`Parsing failed in line ${e.line}`)
}
~~~

### CLI

`./bin/pg2json.js` and `./bin/json2pg.js` parse and serialize, respectively.

`./bin/neo2pg.js` can be used to dump the default graph from a Neo4J database. First argument must be a JSON file with credentials like this:

~~~json
{
  "uri": "neo4j://example.org",
  "user": "alice",
  "password": "secret"
}
~~~

The script requires to install node package `neo4j-driver` (this is done
automatically by calling `npm install` but not if this package is installed as
dependency of another project).
