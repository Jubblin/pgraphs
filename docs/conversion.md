### GraphML

- No support of multi-labels
- No support of null values

## YARS-PG

YARS-PG seems to be fully compatible with PG, depending on the specific version:

- YARS-PG 3.0.0 does not supports nodes or edges without labels
- YARS-PG 3.0.0 limits allowed node identifiers and goes beyond the property graph model
  by inclusion of additional language features such as graph metadata and schemas.

Additional restrictions seems to apply on values with newlines in it.
